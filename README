An app to help you get started with AngularJS, Play! Scala, and MongoDB.

The whole app (including the Angular stuff) can be built, tested and deployed within the Play! lifecycle.
This makes it easy to push it up to Heroku or similar. It also makes it easy for non-UI guys (like me) to get started.

To get started clone the repo and in the project root run 'npm install'. Other than that standard play tasks apply other than the custom 'jsTest' which runs the javascript tests only. 'test' runs the jsTests as well as scala units, integration and browser tests.

Features:

* Authentication 
* basic json parsing/validation
* reactive mongo
* coffeescript
* css/js minification, response gzipping
* angular validation
* Dependency Injection using Spring Scala, DI of controllers
* examples of Javascript unit test, Controller spec, server side integration / browser tests
* jsTest task added to build to allow running of Javascript tests using Karma/Jasmine 

I have used various resources from all over the place to put this together, some of those I can remember include:
